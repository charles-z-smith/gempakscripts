Purpose:  These scripts are mostly of education purpose, but could be modified to one's own needs
Also to showcase my abilities in gempak and csh.

radgen.csh >  Create N0Q, N0R, N1P, NTP images for the set of sites described in the script.
satgen.csh > Create VIS-IR of certain areas of interest
radgenregions.csh >  Create a radar composite of areas of interest.
surfaceplotgen.csh > Create surface plots based off of metar observations and some plots which feature one variable.

Each script will have a more detailed description about what it does.

Installation:
If you plan to use these scripts, you will need to modify a few lines.

First the output directory in some scripts is defined by $DIRECTORY and will need to be changed.
It would also be prudent to search for any "/atmo/web" strings and change or remove these.

Also,  some scripts output by GF(Graphics FIle) instead of a GIF Image.  Depending on your GEMPAK installation,  you may need to change these
the DEVICE output from...

GF|imagename.gif|800;600
to...
GIF|imagename.gif|800;600

and remove the lines

Xvfb :2 -screen 0 1280x1024x24 &
setenv DISPLAY atmo.math.uwm.edu:2.0

at the top of the script.
